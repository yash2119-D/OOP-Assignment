        "#-------------------->> Qution Answer <<--------------------\n",
        "#Q - 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n",
        "  - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around **objects**, which represent real-world entities or concepts. Objects are instances of **classes**, which define their properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Principles of OOP\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**:  \n",
        "   - Bundles data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class).  \n",
        "   - Restricts direct access to some components to ensure data integrity and promote modularity.\n",
        "   - Example: Using private or protected attributes with getter and setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Inheritance**:  \n",
        "   - Enables new classes (child classes) to inherit properties and methods from existing classes (parent classes).  \n",
        "   - Promotes code reusability and hierarchical class structures.  \n",
        "   - Example: A `Car` class might inherit from a `Vehicle` class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Polymorphism**:  \n",
        "   - Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.  \n",
        "   - Supports method overriding and method overloading.  \n",
        "   - Example: A `draw()` method in a `Shape` class can have different implementations in `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle` classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Abstraction**:  \n",
        "   - Hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features of an object.  \n",
        "   - Achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.  \n",
        "   - Example: A user interacts with a `RemoteControl` object without knowing the internal mechanisms of the TV.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of OOP\n",
        "- **Modularity**: Code is organized into manageable, reusable pieces.\n",
        "- **Reusability**: Classes and objects can be reused across different programs.\n",
        "- **Scalability**: Easy to extend functionality through inheritance or adding new classes.\n",
        "- **Maintainability**: Encapsulation helps in isolating changes, reducing the impact on other parts of the codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "### OOP Concepts in Popular Languages\n",
        "OOP principles are implemented in many languages, including:\n",
        "- **Python**: Uses `class` and `def` keywords.\n",
        "- **Java**: Strongly enforces OOP concepts, requiring every program to be class-based.\n",
        "- **C++**: Supports both OOP and procedural programming paradigms.\n",
        "- **C#**: Designed with OOP as a core concept.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example in Python:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return f\"{self.name} makes a sound\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return f\"{self.name} barks\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return f\"{self.name} meows\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using the classes\n",
        "dog = Dog(\"Rex\")\n",
        "cat = Cat(\"Whiskers\")\n",
        "\n",
        "print(dog.speak())  # Output: Rex barks\n",
        "print(cat.speak())  # Output: Whiskers meows\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q - 2. What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Characteristics of a Class\n",
        "1. **Attributes (Properties)**:  \n",
        "   - Variables that hold the data or state of an object.  \n",
        "   - Example: In a `Car` class, attributes like `color`, `brand`, and `model` describe the car.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Methods (Behaviors)**:  \n",
        "   - Functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors or actions the object can perform.  \n",
        "   - Example: A `Car` class might have methods like `start()`, `stop()`, and `accelerate()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Constructors**:  \n",
        "   - Special methods used to initialize objects when they are created.  \n",
        "   - In Python, the constructor is defined as `__init__()`.  \n",
        "   - Example: In a `Person` class, the constructor can set the person's `name` and `age`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Access Modifiers**:  \n",
        "   - Control the visibility of attributes and methods.  \n",
        "   - Common levels are:\n",
        "     - **Public**: Accessible from anywhere.\n",
        "     - **Private**: Accessible only within the class.\n",
        "     - **Protected**: Accessible within the class and its subclasses.\n",

        "  - In Python, **method overloading** refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. However, **Python does not natively support method overloading** in the traditional sense (like in Java or C++), where you can define multiple methods with the same name but different numbers or types of parameters. In Python, the latest method definition overrides any previous ones with the same name.\n",
        "\n",
        "That being said, **method overloading** can still be simulated in Python using default arguments, variable-length arguments (`*args` and `**kwargs`), or by checking the types or number of arguments inside the method.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 1. **Code Reusability**:\n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes in a unified way. By using common interfaces or base classes, you can reuse code without worrying about the specific type of object being used.\n",
        "   - For example, if you have a `Shape` class and various subclasses like `Circle`, `Rectangle`, etc., you can write a single function that works with any `Shape` without needing to know the exact subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Flexibility and Maintainability**:\n",
        "   - With polymorphism, you can extend your code with new classes that fit into an existing framework without changing the code that already uses the base class or interface.\n",
        "   - This makes the system flexible because new functionality can be added without altering existing code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs and making the codebase easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Decoupling and Abstraction**:\n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows you to define interfaces or base classes that abstract away the specific details of the implementation. This decouples the user of a class from its implementation.\n",
        "   - For example, a function that accepts a `Shape` can work with any shape (e.g., `Circle`, `Square`) without knowing the specific type, which allows you to change the implementation without affecting the clients of that function.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Simplifies Code**:\n",
        "   - Without polymorphism, you would need to write separate code for each possible type (e.g., if you had different methods for `Circle` and `Square`), which can quickly lead to duplicated code.\n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows you to generalize the approach and write more concise and elegant code that can handle a variety of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Support for Dynamic Behavior (Late Binding)**:\n",
        "   - In polymorphism, particularly with method overriding, the appropriate method is determined at runtime (also known as dynamic dispatch or late binding). This allows objects of different types to behave appropriately depending on their actual class, even if they are referenced through a common base type or interface.\n",
        "   - This is essential for achieving behaviors like dynamic method invocation in a flexible manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Enhances Design Patterns**:\n",
        "   - Many design patterns, such as the **Strategy Pattern**, **Command Pattern**, and **Factory Pattern**, rely heavily on polymorphism to provide flexibility and adaptability in the system architecture.\n",
        "   - By allowing objects to take on different behaviors at runtime, polymorphism supports various design patterns that help create more robust and scalable software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Polymorphism:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        pass\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "def make_animal_speak(animal: Animal):\n",
        "    print(animal.speak())\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using polymorphism\n",
        "dog = Dog()\n",
        "cat = Cat()\n",
        "\n",
        "make_animal_speak(dog)  # Output: Woof!\n",
        "make_animal_speak(cat)  # Output: Meow!\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In the example above:\n",
        "- `Dog` and `Cat` are subclasses of `Animal`, and they each provide their own implementation of the `speak()` method.\n",
        "- The `make_animal_speak` function works with any object that is a subclass of `Animal`, demonstrating how polymorphism allows handling different object types in a unified way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "Polymorphism is vital in OOP because it increases the flexibility, scalability, and maintainability of code, reduces redundancy, and helps in implementing design patterns effectively. By allowing objects to be treated as instances of their base type, it enables developers to write more general, reusable, and extensible code.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q - 15. What is an abstract class in Python ?\n",
        "  - An **abstract class** in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be subclassed. It defines a common interface for its subclasses, ensuring that certain methods are implemented by them. Abstract classes are used to provide a blueprint for other classes to follow, without providing full implementation details.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the `abc` module (Abstract Base Classes) is used to define abstract classes. The `ABC` class from this module is the base class for defining abstract classes, and the `@abstractmethod` decorator is used to mark methods that must be implemented by any subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points:\n",
        "- **Cannot be instantiated directly**: You cannot create an object of an abstract class.\n",
        "- **Defines abstract methods**: These are methods that are declared but not implemented in the abstract class, and must be overridden in subclasses.\n",
        "- **Used for inheritance**: Subclasses of an abstract class must implement the abstract methods defined in the base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "class Animal(ABC):\n",

        "#Q - 16. What are the advantages of OOP ?\n",
        "  -Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages that make it a widely adopted programming paradigm. Here are some of the key benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Modularity**: OOP promotes the creation of classes and objects that are self-contained, making the code easier to maintain and debug. By breaking down problems into smaller, manageable components, developers can focus on individual pieces of the program without affecting the entire system.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reusability**: OOP allows developers to reuse existing code through inheritance, reducing duplication and improving the efficiency of software development. A class can inherit functionality from another class, which can be extended or modified for new use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Encapsulation**: OOP emphasizes encapsulating data (attributes) and the functions (methods) that manipulate them within a class. This helps in hiding the internal workings and protecting the integrity of the data, leading to better security and data management.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Abstraction**: OOP enables developers to focus on high-level operations by abstracting away complex details. This simplification makes the code easier to understand and use while allowing for implementation flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Flexibility through Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enhances flexibility and scalability, making it easier to extend and modify the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Maintainability**: Since OOP encourages the separation of concerns, it is easier to locate and fix issues. Code changes in one part of the program are less likely to affect other areas, improving long-term maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Improved Collaboration**: OOP encourages modular development, where different team members can work on separate classes or modules concurrently. This makes it easier to collaborate on large projects with multiple developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Scalability**: OOP systems can grow and evolve over time. New classes can be added with minimal changes to existing code, which makes it a good choice for large, complex software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Real-World Mapping**: OOP is based on the concept of \"objects\" that model real-world entities. This makes it easier to design software that reflects the problem domain, improving the alignment between the system and its requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, OOP helps developers write clean, modular, and maintainable code while making it easier to manage complexity in large systems.\n",

        "#Q - 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable ?\n",
        "  - The difference between a **class variable** and an **instance variable** in object-oriented programming is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Class Variable**:\n",
        "- **Definition**: A class variable is a variable that is shared among all instances of a class. It is defined within the class and is accessed using the class name or through instances of the class.\n",
        "- **Scope**: The value of a class variable is the same across all instances of the class, i.e., it is common to all objects.\n",
        "- **Modification**: If a class variable is modified through one instance, the change is reflected in all instances.\n",
        "- **Declaration**: Class variables are typically defined outside of methods, directly inside the class body.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    wheels = 4  # Class variable\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __init__(self, color):\n",

        "print(car2.wheels)  # Outputs 4\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Instance Variable**:\n",
        "- **Definition**: An instance variable is a variable that is specific to an instance of the class. Each object (instance) of the class has its own copy of the instance variable.\n",
        "- **Scope**: The value of an instance variable can be different for each instance of the class.\n",
        "- **Modification**: Changes to an instance variable affect only that particular instance, not others.\n",
        "- **Declaration**: Instance variables are defined inside the `__init__()` method (or other methods) and are usually prefixed with `self.`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    wheels = 4  # Class variable\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __init__(self, color):\n",
        "        self.color = color  # Instance variable\n",

        "print(car2.color)  # Outputs 'blue'\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary of Differences:\n",
        "- **Class variable**: Shared among all instances, declared inside the class.\n",
        "- **Instance variable**: Unique to each instance, declared inside instance methods (e.g., `__init__`).\n",

        "\n",
        "#Q - 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python ?\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit from more than one base class. This enables a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes, making it possible to combine behaviors from different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Mammal:\n",
        "    def walk(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Mammal walks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal, Mammal):  # Multiple inheritance\n",
        "    def bark(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an object of the Dog class\n",
        "dog = Dog()\n",
        "dog.speak()  # Inherited from Animal class\n",
        "dog.walk()   # Inherited from Mammal class\n",
        "dog.bark()   # Defined in Dog class\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `Dog` class inherits from both `Animal` and `Mammal`, so it can access methods from both of these parent classes. The main advantage of multiple inheritance is the ability to mix different functionalities from different base classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points:\n",
        "1. **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**: When using multiple inheritance, Python uses a method resolution order (MRO) to determine which method to call in case of ambiguity. The MRO is based on the C3 linearization algorithm.\n",
        "2. **Avoiding Diamond Problem**: The diamond problem arises when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. Python resolves this problem using the C3 linearization approach, ensuring that the methods are called in a consistent order.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of Diamond Problem:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    def method(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Method in class A\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class B(A):\n",
        "    def method(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Method in class B\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class C(A):\n",
        "    def method(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Method in class C\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class D(B, C):  # Multiple inheritance (B and C both inherit A)\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "\n",
        "d = D()\n",
        "d.method()  # Resolves which method to call from B or C based on MRO\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple inheritance should be used carefully, as it can make the code complex and harder to maintain.\n",

        "\n",
        "#Q - 19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "  - In Python, the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods are special methods used to define how an object is represented as a string in different contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`__str__` method**:\n",
        "   - Purpose: It is used to define the string representation of an object when you use `print()` or `str()` on that object.\n",
        "   - The `__str__` method should return a string that is easy for humans to read and understand.\n",
        "   - If you don’t define it, Python will fall back to the default implementation, which includes the memory address of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Person:\n",

        "   print(p)  # Output: Person: John, Age: 30\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`__repr__` method**:\n",
        "   - Purpose: It is used to define the string representation of an object that is meant for developers or debugging purposes. When you call `repr()` or enter the object in the interpreter (e.g., `>>>`), Python will use the `__repr__` method.\n",
        "   - The `__repr__` method should return a string that, if possible, could be used to recreate the object (i.e., it should be a valid Python expression).\n",
        "   - If you don’t define it, Python will fall back to the default implementation, which is similar to the `__str__` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Person:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "           self.name = name\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Access Parent Class Methods**: It allows you to call a method from a base (parent) class without directly referencing the parent class name, which can be useful when working with multiple inheritance.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Animal:\n",
        "       def speak(self):\n",
        "           print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",

        "   Dog barks\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Avoid Hard-Coding Parent Class Name**: Using `super()` ensures that the correct method is called in case of multiple inheritance. This is important because hard-coding the class name would make your code more fragile and less reusable.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "4. **Initialization in Inheritance**: It's often used to call the initializer (`__init__`) method of the parent class to ensure that the parent class is properly initialized before the child class does any additional setup.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Improves Code Maintainability**: By using `super()`, the code is more maintainable and extensible. If the parent class name changes, you don’t need to go and update every call to the parent class method; `super()` handles it automatically.\n",

        "  -\n",
        "The `__del__` method in Python is a special method, often referred to as a **destructor**. It is invoked when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when it is garbage collected). While Python uses automatic memory management (through garbage collection) and typically does not require manual memory management, `__del__` can be used to define custom cleanup actions that should occur when an object is no longer needed.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Destructor for Object Cleanup**:\n",

        "   - Python has a garbage collector that automatically frees memory by deleting objects that are no longer referenced. The `__del__` method is called just before the object is destroyed by the garbage collector. However, this timing is not guaranteed and can be unpredictable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Avoid Using `__del__` for Critical Cleanup**:\n",
        "   - Since Python’s garbage collection is not deterministic (i.e., the exact time when an object will be garbage collected is uncertain), relying on `__del__` for critical resource cleanup (like closing a file or database connection) is generally discouraged. It is better to use explicit resource management techniques, such as:\n",
        "     - The `with` statement (context managers) for resource management.\n",
        "     - Manually calling cleanup methods (e.g., `close()`).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Potential Pitfalls**:\n",
        "   - Circular references can prevent the garbage collector from deallocating objects properly, which can lead to the `__del__` method not being called. This is because Python's garbage collector cannot collect objects involved in circular references if they have `__del__` methods.\n",
        "   - If `__del__` raises an exception, it is silently ignored, which can lead to unexpected behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Example with `with` Statement**:\n",
        "   To ensure proper cleanup, it’s often recommended to use a context manager with the `with` statement, which guarantees that resources are cleaned up properly without relying on `__del__`.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example of a context manager:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class FileHandler:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, filename):\n",
        "           self.file = open(filename, 'w')\n",

        "       handler.write('Hello, World!')\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   In this case, `__exit__` is automatically called when the `with` block ends, ensuring that the file is properly closed.\n",
        "\n",

        "A `staticmethod` is a method that does not take a reference to the instance (`self`) or the class (`cls`) as its first argument.

        "\n",

        "#Q - 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in Python refers to the ability of different classes to respond to the same method or operator in different ways. It is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows methods to have the same name but behave differently depending on the object that is calling them. In Python, polymorphism is typically implemented using inheritance, where child classes can override methods defined in a parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Polymorphism Works with Inheritance in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of inheritance, polymorphism allows a subclass to define a method with the same name as a method in its superclass. When an instance of the subclass calls the method, the method in the subclass is executed, not the one in the superclass. This is known as **method overriding**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python achieves polymorphism through **dynamic typing**, meaning that the method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the object that is calling it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Polymorphism with Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's consider an example with a base class `Animal` and two subclasses `Dog` and `Cat`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Cat meows\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create instances of Dog and Cat\n",
        "dog = Dog()\n",
        "cat = Cat()\n",
        "\n",
        "# Call the same method `speak()` on both instances\n",
        "dog.speak()  # Output: Dog barks\n",
        "cat.speak()  # Output: Cat meows\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points About Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Method Overriding**: In the example above, both `Dog` and `Cat` override the `speak()` method that is defined in the `Animal` class. This is polymorphism in action: the same method name (`speak()`) behaves differently depending on the type of object calling it.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Method Resolution**: Python determines at runtime which `speak()` method to call. If you call `speak()` on an instance of `Dog`, Python will invoke the `speak()` method from the `Dog` class. If you call it on an instance of `Cat`, Python will use the `speak()` method from the `Cat` class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Flexible and Extensible**: Polymorphism makes code more flexible and extensible. You can create new subclasses that override methods from the parent class, and your existing code will work without modification, as long as it expects the same method signature. This is a key advantage of polymorphism in large, complex applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism with Parent Class References**: You can also use polymorphism when referring to objects of different classes using a reference to the base class. This allows you to write more generic code that can work with different types of objects as long as they share a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def make_animal_speak(animal):\n",
        "       animal.speak()  # The correct `speak()` method is called based on the object's class\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Both dog and cat are passed as references of the same parent class, Animal\n",
        "   make_animal_speak(Dog())  # Output: Dog barks\n",
        "   make_animal_speak(Cat())  # Output: Cat meows\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Type of Object at Runtime**: The method that gets executed is determined by the **type of the object at runtime**, not the type of the reference variable. This is known as **late binding** or **dynamic dispatch**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Code Reusability**: You can write functions or methods that can work with objects of different classes, as long as they implement the same method (e.g., `speak()`).\n",
        "- **Maintainability**: Polymorphism makes your code more maintainable by allowing you to add new classes without modifying existing code that works with the parent class or base class.\n",
        "- **Flexibility**: It provides flexibility in how objects are manipulated, making it easier to extend the behavior of your program by simply adding more subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism with inheritance allows different classes to provide their own implementations of methods defined in a common parent class. Python achieves this through dynamic typing and method overriding, enabling flexibility, reusability, and maintainability in object-oriented programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q - 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP ?\n",
        "  - **Method chaining** in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to the practice of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line of code. Each method call returns the object itself (or another object), allowing for successive method calls without the need to re-reference the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, this is achieved by having each method return `self`, which represents the current instance of the object. This allows you to chain the methods together.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
        "        self.make = make\n",

        "Honk! Honk!\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation:\n",
        "- In this example, we create an instance of the `Car` class and call the `accelerate`, `brake`, and `honk` methods in a chained manner.\n",
        "- Each method returns `self`, which allows the next method to be called on the same object without needing to reference the object again.\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining improves code readability and allows concise expressions, especially for modifying object state step-by-step.\n",

        "#Q - 25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python ?\n",
        "  - In Python, the `__call__` method allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function. This means that you can define behavior for an object when it is called with parentheses, similar to how functions are invoked.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The `__call__` method is a special method, also known as a magic method or dunder method, that is invoked when you use the syntax `object()`.\n",
        "- You can define custom logic inside `__call__`, and when the object is \"called\", that logic is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class MyClass:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, message):\n",

        "obj()  # Output: Hello, World!\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose and Use Cases:\n",
        "1. **Function-like behavior**: If you want an object to behave like a function, you can use `__call__` to define the function-like behavior.\n",
        "2. **Callable objects**: You might want to create callable objects that perform specific tasks or computations when invoked, such as a decorator or a handler for callbacks.\n",
        "3. **Stateful functions**: You can use `__call__` to create stateful functions where each call can be based on internal state that the object maintains.\n",
